I am currently affiliated with Department of Computer Engineering at Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Türkiye as an assistant professor. Prior to joining here, I was a faculty member of Department of Computer Engineering at Iskenderun Technical University for 3 years (2020 - 2023). I obtained my Ph.D.(2019) and M.Sc.(2013) degrees from the Department of Computer Engineering at Hacettepe University, under the supervision of [Aykut Erdem](https://aykuterdem.github.io/) and [Erkut Erdem](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~erkut/). During my Ph.D., I had the opportunity to visit the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab, University of Amsterdam (UvA), Netherlands to work with [Zeynep Akata](https://www.eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata) from October 2018 to January 2019.

My primary research interests are centered around image and video processing, with a focus on leveraging deep learning, particularly through deep generative models. I am highly enthusiastic about exploring innovative approaches to address a broad spectrum of challenges within the domains of computer vision and computer graphics such as camera localization, video stabilization, object goal navigation, etc. I am open to collaborations aimed at tackling the diverse challenges in these exciting fields and contributing to advancements.
